# ISS-satellite-tracking
In this project, we aim to create a dynamic and interactive Jupyter notebook application that tracks the real-time location of the International Space Station (ISS) and displays its path on a world map.
We will achieve this by fetching live data from NASA's Open Notify API, which provides the ISS's current coordinates.
We use the Folium library, which is a Python wrapper for Leaflet.js, to create an interactive and visually appealing world map.
The map serves as the canvas for displaying the ISS's location and path.
